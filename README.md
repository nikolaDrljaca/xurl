If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:

```
2024-12-04 14:32:45.584 [main] INFO  Application - Application started in 0.303 seconds.
2024-12-04 14:32:45.682 [main] INFO  Application - Responding at http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

## Design

Main points to consider:

1. Gather Requirements
2. API Design / Database Design
3. High-Level system design
4. Deep dives

### Requirements

Functional Requirements (domain sourcing):
1. URL shortening - create a unique URL 
2. URL redirection
3. Link analytics (number of clicks)
4. Custom links - instead of randomly generated characters

Non-functional requirements (technical):
1. Minimize redirect latencyâ€”consider 301/302 status codes for cashing. This can interfere with analytics
2. How many URLs should the system support? Lets say 1 billion
-> We want 7 characters for keys, gives ~ 8b combinations (for 26 ascii characters)
3. High-Read Low-Write service
4. URL shortening strategy - how are keys created?

### API / Database Design

```http request
POST /hops HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{ "url" : "some-slug" }

###
GET /hops/{key} HTTP/1.1
```

```mermaid
erDiagram 
    HOP {
        uuid id
        text hop_key
        text long_url
        timestamp created_at
    }
```

### System Design

Characteristics:
* A hop key is 7 alphabetic characters, gives pool of 8b mappings.
* Given the database structure, we store:
  * 70 bytes at least per record, for 1b records thats ~70GB (minimum)
  * 36 (id) + 7 (key) + 19 (time) + ~8(db) + x(url)
* This is high-read, low-write service, so should be optimized for reading

Key creation strategy:
* Use an incrementing counter and base62 encoding
  * This assumes the base62 alphabet is used for keys.
  * Each key creation the counter is incremented and that value is encoded with base62 resulting in the key.
  * Offers predictability.
  * If the service holds this counter in-memory, increasing the number of instances will create issues and collisions
  since each instance will start with a new counter (assuming it starts from 0).
  * To solve this Redis (or any other in-memory single threaded cache) can be used.
* Use a randomly generated string **our pick**
    * Define an alphabet and use seeds or secure-random algorithms to generate keys.
    * Instances are stateless.
    * Small chances of collisions can be handled with retries.
* Hash input URL and slice length of the key
  * A hashing algorithm (md5, sha256) is applied once/twice to a URL and the first/last X characters are chosen
  * Offers predictability
  * Instances are stateless
  * Collision handling slightly more complex since you have to keep track of how many times the URL was hashed

Suggested designs:

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(cloud)[XURL]

    service client(internet)[Client]
    service xurl(server)[Service] in api
    service cache(database)[Cache] in api
    service db(database)[Database] in api

    client:R -- L:xurl
    xurl:T -- B:cache
    xurl:R -- L:db 
```

* To optimize for high-read, an in memory cache is used. 
* The overall design is straightforward and has low cognitive load.
* Low fault tolerance, if the service is down everything is unavailable.

---

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(cloud)[XURL]

    service client(internet)[Client]
    service gw(server)[Gateway] in api
    service read(server)[read] in api
    service write(server)[write] in api
    service cache(database)[Cache] in api
    service db(database)[Database] in api
    junction jmain
    junction jread
    junction jwrite
    junction jdb

    client:R -- L:gw
    gw:R -- L:jmain
    read:B -- T:jmain
    write:T -- B:jmain
    read:L -- R:cache

    read:R -- L:jread
    jread:B -- T:jdb
    jdb:R -- L:db
    write:R -- L:jwrite
    jwrite:T -- B:jdb
    
```

* Separates creation and redirection into separate services to increase fault tolerance.
  * If creation is not working, redirection+analytics still works
* Still has the same benefits of the design above
* Increases cognitive load and deployment complexity

---

The second design can be improved even further by introducing a message queue into the write path.
In cases where the service is experiencing not only high read but high write situations, this can be an improvement.
This design introduces:
* High throughput on both paths
* Eventual consistency
* High cognitive load, high deployment complexity

How it works:
* A message queue is used to hand off write messages. The service generates a hop key, hands off the message
to the queue and returns, greatly increasing response times.
* A service sits in between the queue and the database. It consumes each message, one by one in order, processes
and stores them into the cache and the database achieving consistency.
* If this in-between service goes down, messages are stored in the queue and will be processed. This service should have
a backup instance running always and a rapid startup time.
